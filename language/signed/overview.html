                    ASL originated in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of oral language to sign language, compounded by the fact that ASL is often glossed in English due to the lack of a standard writing system.

                    ASL signs have a number of phonemic components, including movement of the face and torso as well as the hands. ASL is not a form of pantomime, but iconicity does play a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling, although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal agreement and aspectual marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers. Many linguists believe ASL to be a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, but there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.
					<p><b>Equestrian sign language (ESL)</b> is a natural language that is mainly used in Equestria, though some other smaller colonies of Equestria use it as well. Primarily, the main dialect originates from the Canterlot-Ponyville region, as that is where it originated. Lands bordering neighbouring kingdoms often have a pidgin or creole language based on ESL, allowing individuals to communicate without translators or knoweledge of each other's language(s). Because of ponies' unique limbs (being that they have no digits by which to convey information), the most similar sign language would be that of Zebran sign language (ZSL). Despite the similar anatomy, ESL and ZSL are only truly comparable in the other methods of information relay that are used due to the lack of opposable fingers, claws, or toes. Very few words are shared or derived from each other.</p>
                    <p>ESL developed circa 1400 AFF, developing primarily in Canterlotian schools.</p>
