					<b>Equestrian sign language (ESL)</b> is a natural language that is mainly used in <a href="#">Equestria</a>, though some other smaller <a
                            href="#">colonies of Equestria</a> use it as well. Primarily, the main dialect originates from the Canterlot-Ponyville region. Lands bordering neighboring kingdoms often have a pidgin or creole language based on ESL, allowing individuals to communicate without translators or knowledge of each other's language(s). Because of ponies' limbs (being that they have no digits by which to convey information), the most similar sign language would be that of <a
                            href="#">Zebran sign language (ZSL)</a>. Despite the similar anatomy, ESL and ZSL are only truly comparable in the other methods of information relay that are used due to the lack of opposable fingers, claws, or toes. Very few words are shared or derived from each other, and ESL and ZSL developed separately.<br>
                    ESL developed circa 1400 AFF, developing primarily in Canterlotian schools. ESL spread outward from there, first traveling north, then back south. Linguists have a decent estimate of the number of ESL users, ranging about 500,000 ponies across Equestria.

                <p>While archaeologists have found evidence for sign languages in ponies as far back as 923 AFF, signing
                    was not standardized, and often simply a pidgin or creole, mostly in family groups or small
                    communities. </p><br>

                the alphabet for esl is the same as equestrian. while vowels are not marked in equestrian, esl does have
                individual signs for each vowel. b d d͡j d͡z f g h i j k m n o p r s t t͡s t͡ʃ u v w z œ ɑ ɥ ɪ ɫ ʃ ʙ
