					<p>The <b>timeline of equine history</b> denotes all history of equine beings, from evolution to present day. While current archaeology is able to date events, dates are still only relative, and should should not be assumed to be absolute, unless otherwise specified. Civilizations of ponies have existed for at least 20,000 years, though permanent settlements did not truly exist until about 100,000 years before the foundation of Equestria (0 AFF). Small scale agriculture existed as early as 120,000 BFF.</p><br>
					<p>The earliest ponies lived in small family groups, or "herds". Young stallions left their family herd to create another, unless they wished to challenge the herd stallion. While males did protect a herd, it was usually a mare that was the true leader of the herd group. Earth ponies are the oldest branch of equines, dating back well over 100,000 years, though ancestors of the modern pony have been identified as old as 40 million years old. The next group of ponies to emerge were the pegai, likely developing in the higher mountains of Equestrian land.</p><br>

					<h2>Periodization</h2>
					<hr><br>
					<p>Pre-equestrian history is most often labeled as ancient history, up until the first pony tribes developed (circa 7000 BFF–1400 BFF). The classical era is then from roughly 1400 BFF to 632 AFF. The post–classical age spans from 632 AFF to 1673 AFF, marking Luna's banishment to the moon. The early modern period is usually considered to extend from the 1600's to the 2000's. The modern period then begins, which includes the present day.</p>

					<h2>Prehistory</h2>
					<hr><br>
					<span id="early-eq" class="header">Early equines</span><br><br>
					<p>While anatomically modern equines did not develop until at least 10 million years ago, close relatives of ponies go back as far as 40 million years. From genetic lineage, it's approximated that modern ponies developed first in roughly what is now modern day Vanhoover (otherwise known as the "Hoof of Society", due to it's fertile lands, and the fact that some of the first settlements emerged from here). From there, ponies spread both further north, as well as south and east. This migration led to the different races of ponies. The early zebra also emerged at around this time, travelling further south to the tropical reigon around the Equator</p><br>
					<p>Within 4 million years, ponies habited most of modern day Equestria, excluding the Frozen North. Language developed roughly 3 million years ago, though it tended to be specific to race and family groups, rather than a common language. Cultural expression, such as art, earthenware, burials, and jewelry emerged at about the same time that language did. From pony–left artifacts, it appears that most ponies were scared and mystified by unicorns, due to their ability to harness raw magic.</p><br>
					<p>Very few ponies lived in a region that could sustain them all year, so nearly all herds were nomadic, following plants through the seasons. Agriculture did not develop until 100,000 BFF, and the herds that were almost sedentary still foraged.</p><br>
					<span id="early-civ" class="header">Early civilization</span><br><br>
					<p>With the development of agriculture, Earth ponies used their magic to tend to the land. The crops grown by ponies tended to be of higher quality, due to both artifical selection, as well as the Earth ponies' care. Because of this, Earth ponies were among the first of ponykind to settle down and create civilization. While tensions remained high between equine races, some Earth herds allowed pegai and unicorns to join their herd. Despite the fragile peace in the Hoof of Society, it was not until the Fire of Friendship that ponies truly began to co–exist.</p>
